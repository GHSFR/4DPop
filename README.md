# <a name="overview">Overview</a>

4DPop is the container component that handles loading and provides an interface to compatible components.

This component manages a palette, displayed in design mode, in which new icons will be displayed as compatible components are installed.

> üìçAll 4DPop components are designed for development mode only and should not be included in the final application.

# <a name="installation">Installation</a>

1. Create a `Components` folder next to the `Project` folder of your database ‚ë†.
2. Place the `4DPop.4dbase` component ‚ë° in the `Components` folder.
3. Place one or more `4DPop components` you want to use in the same folder. 
3. Open your database.
4. Open the structure settings dialog and go to the `Security` page to activate, if any, the option `Execute "On Host Database Event" Method of the component`‚ë¢
5. Reopen the database, the palette is displayed in the lower left corner of the screen in Design mode.

‚ë†: For a binary database, the `Components` folder must be located next to the structure file of your database (".4db").

‚ë°: On `macOS`, the component is a package whose ".4dbase" extension is not necessarily visible depending on your display preference settings.

‚ë¢: If you dont't want to use the automatic launch of the palette see [Launch the palette with code](#launch-with-code)

>üìçIt is always preferable to use an alias file (macOS) or shortcut file (Windows) instead of the component and thus store the originals in a single copy. Updates will be simplified especially if you maintain several projects. 

# <a name="compatible-components">Compatible Components</a>

Some developers provide tools that are displayed in the 4DPop palette. You can access the [list of compatible components](https://github.com/topics/4dpop) referenced on Github (with the `4dpop` topic).

# <a name="how-to">How to make a component compatible with 4DPop?</a>

The compatibility of a component with the 4DPop palette is based on the presence of a "4DPop.xml" file in its "Resources" folder. 

This XMLfile describes the elements of the component that will be available with keys and their attributes.

Something like:

```XML
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="no" ?>    
<tools name=":xliff:Ruler" picture="Ruler.png" helptip=":xliff:ToolHelpTip" initProc="Init">
    <tool name="Rulers" method="4DPop_ScreenRuler"/>
</tools>
```

## Keys

### \<tools>
Start and end of file. Mandatory

#### Attributes
* **name**: Name as it will be displayed below the button ‚ë† (mandatory).
* **picture**: Name of the picture file of the button. This file must be located at the root of the "Resources" folder of the component (optionally, if omitted a default picture is used).
* **helptip**: Text of help tip associated with button ‚ë†
* **initproc**: Name of the component method ‚ë° to be executed on loading. 
* **ondrop**: Name of the component method ‚ë° to be executed at the time of a drop on the button. 
* **default**: Name of the component method ‚ë° to be executed for a simple clic on the button when more than one tool is available.
* **popup**: Display flag of the pop-up arrow linked with the button . Values: "True" (to display the arrow even when there is only one <tool> key, see below)

### \<tool>
Start and end of definition of a tool.

This key can be repeated: 

* if there is only one <tool> key, the method is executed as soon as the button is clicked; 
* if there are several <tool> keys, a menu arrow linked with the button is displayed and a menu listing the available tools is provided for the user. 

In case of the default attribute above is defined, a simple clic launches the method referenced and a long click or an on arrow click display the tools' menu.

#### Attributes
* **name**: Name of the tool as it will appear in the menu associated with the button ‚ë† (mandatory if there are several <tool> keys)
* **method**: Name of the component method ‚ë° corresponding to the tool to be executed (mandatory) 

‚ë† These attributes accept the syntax ":xliff :resname", so the strings must be located in the xliff files of the components and the displayed string will be localized.

‚ë° The called methods must have been declared as shared in the component database. All the methods receive a pointer as parameter (on the button of the palette. this pointer can be used to test the state of the button or to correctly display a popup). If you plan to compile the component, this parameter must be declared explicitly [var $1 : Pointer] in all the methods of the component called by 4DPop (initproc, ondrop, default, and method) if not, an error will be generated each time the method is called (-20008 - incorrect Parameters in a command EXECUTER).

> üìçThe component method can be responsible for building and displaying the menu. In this case, a single <tool> tag calls the component method whose code displays the menu and processes the choice of the user. In order for the related menu arrow to be displayed on the button of your tool, you must pass "True" in the popup attribute of the <tools> key.

**It will be very appreciated if you publish your component on Github and don't forget to [link your project with the 4DPop topic](#topic).**

# <a name="topic">Topic 4DPop</a>
If you develop a [component compatible with 4DPop](#how-to), it is strongly recommended to add the "4DPop" [topic](https://docs.github.com/en/github/administering-a-repository/managing-repository-settings/classifying-your-repository-with-topics) to be referenced in the [list of 4DPop compatible components] (https://github.com/topics/4dpop).


# <a name="launch-with-code">Launch the palette with code</a> 

If you dont't want to use the automatic launch of the palette, you can do it with this code:

```4D
// Run 4DPop
// This code is available even if the component is not present like in the final application.
If (Not(Is compiled mode))
	ARRAY TEXT($tTxtComponents;0) COMPONENT LIST($tTxtComponents)
	If (Find in array($tTxtComponents;"4DPop")>0)
		EXECUTE METHOD("4DPopPalette")
	End if
End if
```
